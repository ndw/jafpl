Just Another /Fine/ Pipeline Language.

This is a pipeline framework. It is wholly agnostic to the kinds of data
that flow through the pipelines and the implementations of the steps that
process them.

(Early versions of this library were built on top of Akka, but that
work was abandoned and now thereâ€™s just a simple thread pool.)
