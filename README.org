#+TITLE: README

Just Another /Fine/ Pipeline Language.

This is a dead branch. You want the `master` branch.

I misunderstood some of the consequences of the way asynchrony would
play out in an actor framework when I undertook this work.

I’m only really keeping this branch because it contains some useful
demos, like the simple calculator, that I haven’t ported over to the
new framework.
