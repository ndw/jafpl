<para>At the level of this library, you must construct a graph using the
underlying APIs. There’s no “pipeline language” support.
Broadly speaking, there are atomic steps, containers, pipelines (the top-most
container), inputs, outputs, variable bindings, and edges.</para>

<para>You can construct any graph that you like with these nodes and
edges between them. An edge is a connection between an “output port”
on a “source” node and an “input port” on a “destination” node. The edges
are arbitrary; asserting that an edge exists between two ports creates
the ports if necessary. (Some steps impose constraints on the ports that
can be used, those constraints are enforced.)</para>
