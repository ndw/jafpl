processor. It’s the heart of <em class="citetitle">XML Calabash V2.x</em>
which hasn’t been released yet. This hasn’t been released in any
official sense either. YMMV. Here there be dragons. Etc.</p><p>On 19 August, 2017, I completely replaced the implementation.
Some of the documentation below is a little out of date now.
But there are <a href="apidocs/">API Docs</a>, so that’s
something, right?
</p><section id="what" class="section"><div class="section-titlepage"><h2>What is it?</h2></div><p>This is a JVM library for evaluating pipelines composed of
arbitrary steps.</p><p>For the purpose of this discussion, a pipeline is a directed,
acyclic graph. Each node in the graph represents some kind of
processing. The edges between the nodes are how the data flows through
the pipeline.</p><div id="what.4" class="mediaobject"><img src="byhand-1.svg" /></div><p>This library doesn’t care what each node does and it
doesn’t care what kind of data flows between nodes. You construct a
graph with edges. You pour data in at the top, stuff happens, data
pours out the bottom.</p><p>Each node is a “<code class="code">step</code>”. Steps are where “stuff happens”.
Many steps can be implemented as atomic units of work
(henceforth “atomic steps”), but some naturally operate on subgraphs,
these are “containers”. The following containers are supported:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">Groups</span></dt><dd><p>A group is a lexical container, it has no additional semantics.
</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Iteration</span></dt><dd><p>Several flavors of iteration are supported: iteration over a sequence,
iteration while a condition is true, and iteration to a fixed point.
</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Viewports</span></dt><dd><p>A viewport operates on subsections of its input. For example, on
specified keys in a JSON object or on specified descendants in an XML document.
But equally, it could operate on regions of an image or lines of a text file.
</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Conditionals</span></dt><dd><p>A conditional selects one of a set of possible subpipelines, based on
a user-specified condition.
</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Try/catch error handling</span></dt><dd><p>Step implementations may encounter errors and raise exceptions.
A try/catch block gives the pipeline author an opportunity to catch those
errors and react accordingly.
</p></dd><dt><span class="term"></span></dt><dd><p>
</p></dd></dl></div><p>It would be nice to generalize the abstraction of “container” to the
point where a small number of primitives in the core library could be used to
build arbitrary containers. So far, that goal seems elusive.</p></section><section id="where" class="section"><div class="section-titlepage"><h2>Where is it?</h2></div><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="https://travis-ci.org/ndw/jafpl.svg?branch=master" /></span></p><p>It’s <a href="https://github.com/ndw/jafpl">on GitHub</a>.
</p></section><section id="how" class="section"><div class="section-titlepage"><h2>How does it work?</h2></div><p>At the level of this library, you must construct a graph using the
underlying APIs. There’s no “pipeline language” support at this level.
Broadly speaking, there atomic steps, containers, pipelines (the top-most
container), inputs, outputs, and variable bindings.</p><p>You can construct any graph that you like with these nodes and
edges between them. An edge is a connection between an “output port”
on a “source” node and an “input port” on a “destination” node. The edges
are arbitrary; asserting that an edge exists between two ports creates
the ports if necessary.</p><p>There are only a few inviolable constraints on the graph:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol style="list-style: decimal;"><li><p>Edges can only connect nodes in the same graph.
</p></li><li><p>No loops. It’s a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph">DAG</a>.
</p></li><li><p>If steps declare required inputs or required outputs,
those must have edges connected to them.
</p></li></ol></div><p>One of the design flaws in
<a href="http://github.com/ndw/xmlcalabash1/">XML Calabash 1.x</a>
is that the edges between steps have to buffer what they produce and the sequence
has to be replayable. This happens because multiple steps may read the same output
port and the reads may be interleaved. This problem cannot occur in JAFPL.
Every port is read by exactly one step and exactly one step writes to every
input port. If the graph described by your edges multiplexes access to
any port, a “splitter” or “joiner” step will be inserted as appropriate.</p><p>In other words, this graph never happens:</p><div id="how.8" class="mediaobject"><img src="figure0.svg" /></div><p>If you attempt to construct that graph, the library will automatically
restructure it so that this graph is produced:</p><div id="how.10" class="mediaobject"><img src="figure1.svg" /></div><p>You must provide an
<a href="#api">implementation class</a> for every atomic node that you
construct. That’s the class that will be called upon to perform the
work of the step.</p><p>The graph is executed with the <a href="http://akka.io/">Akka</a> framework. Actors are created
to manage each node. All steps “start” at the same time and execute in
parallel (to the extent that the graph allows for parallelism, of
course). When the last step reports that it is finished, execution
finishes.</p><p>The actors know the topology of the graph. Any step that has no
inputs can run immediately. Steps that have inputs, can’t run until
all of their inputs have been provided. Inputs pass between the steps
as messages. Consider the simple, linear pipeline at the beginning of
this document.</p><p>When execution begins, “Do Something” can’t run because
it’s waiting for input from the “outside”. “Do Something Else” can’t
run because it’s waiting for input from “Do Something.” The process
that is running the pipeline pours an arbitrary number of documents
into the input port. Each document is received immediately by “Do
Something”, which is solely responsible for buffering it or doing
whatever is necessary. Eventually, the process running the pipeline
closes the input port.</p><p>At this point, the actor framework tells “Do Something” to run.
It does whatever it does, dropping documents into its output port.
The framework turns those documents into messages that are sent
immediately to “Do Something Else.”</p><p>When “Do Something” finishes, the framework closes each of its
output ports and consequently the input port that is reading it. When
the last input port on “Do Something Else” is closed, the framework
tells it to run. And thus it continues until every step has run. When
every step has run, the pipeline is finished. The process running the
pipeline can collect its results from the output port(s).</p><p>In practice, there are a number of subtleties here. Loops have
to buffer inputs so that they’re available to each iteration. A choose
must make sure that <em>none</em> of the steps in any of its
branches run before a specific branch is selected. Etc.</p><p>This library will amend the graph and introduce additional steps as
necessary to hide all of this complexity from the user.</p><section id="example" class="section"><div class="section-titlepage"><h3>An example</h3></div><p>An example may help. I plan to use this library as the core of
my new XProc implementation, but if you aren’t familiar with XProc
(and odds are, you’re not), that’s not going to be very intuitive.
</p><p>To illustrate how things work, a small repository of demonstration
pipelines is provided at
<a href="https://github.com/ndw/jafpl-demo">https://github.com/ndw/jafpl-demo</a>. One of the larger
examples is the “calc” demo. The calc demo application that uses the
library to evaluate simple arithmetic expressions. Using a pipeline
language for this purpose is a bit crazy, but assuming you understand
how arithmetic works, it demonstrates a features.</p><p>Consider the expression “<code class="code">(1+2)*(3+4+5)</code>”. It’s possible to construct
a pipeline to evaluate this expression:</p><div id="example.5" class="mediaobject"><img src="pipe1.svg" /></div><p>The “Literal” steps are atomic steps that provide numbers. For
convenience, they’re labled “number-<em class="replaceable"><code>n</code></em>” for
the number “n”. These are simple atomic steps with no inputs and a
single output. When they run, they produce the corresponding number on
their output port.</p><p>The expression has been decomposed into a series of binary operations
(3+4+5 = (3+4)+5 because
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_property">addition
is associative</a>). The “BinaryOp” steps perform simple binary arithetic
operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on two inputs.
</p><p>There are no external inputs. When this pipeline starts, the
integer literal steps all execute in parallel, producing one output each.
The additions can also proceed in parallel. Then the multiplication computes
the final sum, “36”, which is output and printed by the demo.</p><p>To see what happens when inputs are required, consider this
expression: “<code class="code">(1+2)*$foo</code>”. Here <code class="code">$foo</code> is an
additional input to the expression. Steps have inputs and outputs and
(almost) nothing else.</p><div id="example.10" class="mediaobject"><img src="pipe2.svg" /></div><p>All atomic steps work basically the same way. There’s also a provision for declaring
a dependency edge between two nodes that aren’t connected by data flow. The semantics
of the dependency are that the <em>dependent</em> step will not be run
before the step it <em>depends on</em> has finished.</p></section></section><section id="api" class="section"><div class="section-titlepage"><h2>Step API</h2></div><p>One of my goals is to conceal as much of the underlying framework
as possible from step implementors. Atomic steps are only required to implement
a simple API; nothing about the framework is exposed. (Containers are
a little trickier; there aren’t any provisions for extension containers at
the moment, but I’m open to suggestions for new containers.)</p><p>The API for atomic steps is straigthforward. Each step
implmentation must implement the
<a href="http://jafpl.com/apidocs/com/jafpl/steps/Step.html">Step</a>
trait.</p><section id="receive" class="section"><div class="section-titlepage"><h3>Receive</h3></div><pre class="programlisting language-none"><code>def receive(port: String, item: Any)</code></pre><p>Receive is how data gets delievered to the step. The actor responsible
for managing the node will call the <code class="methodname">receive</code> method each
time a document arrives.</p></section><section id="setup" class="section"><div class="section-titlepage"><h3>Setup</h3></div><pre class="programlisting language-none"><code>def setup(controller: StepController,
          inputPorts: List[String],
          outputPorts: List[String])</code></pre><p>Setup will be called once before execution begins. The graph
constructor neither knows nor cares about the name and number of
inputs and outputs on each node. Setup is the implementation’s
opportunity to look at the configuration and decide if it’s ok.</p><p>All of the inputs to a step (it’s “document” inputs as
well as any options that it accepts) arrive the same way. The names
used during graph construction will be the names presented here. For
my XProc implementation, incoming options are identified with QNames
names in “Clark” format.</p><p>The implementation should keep a copy of the controller. The
controller is how the step sends data “downstream” to the next step(s)
in the graph. For atomic steps, there’s only one important method on
the controller:</p><pre class="programlisting language-none"><code>def send(port: String, item: GenericItem)</code></pre><p>This method sends the item “out” of specified port. The graph handles
delivery to the other step or steps (if any) that read from that port.</p></section><section id="run" class="section"><div class="section-titlepage"><h3>Run</h3></div><pre class="programlisting language-none"><code>def run()</code></pre><p>After all of the inputs have been delivered, the step will be
asked to run. This will happen <em>at most</em> once. Any inputs that have not
yet been received when <code class="methodname">run</code> is called, have
not been provided.
</p><p>There’s no requirement that an implementation wait until
<code class="methodname">run</code> is called. The identity step, for
example, can send the documents out as fast as they arrive and do
nothing when <code class="methodname">run</code> is called.</p><p>But if a step needs all its inputs before it can run, that’s fine too,
but it is responsible for buffering them.</p><p>When <code class="code">run</code> returns, all of the step’s output ports
will be closed automatically.</p></section><section id="reset" class="section"><div class="section-titlepage"><h3>Reset</h3></div><pre class="programlisting language-none"><code>def reset()</code></pre><p>If the step is in a loop, it will be reset between each iteration.
Steps should not maintain any state across <code class="methodname">reset</code> calls:
flush all cached inputs, return all settings to the defaults that existed
before <code class="methodname">run</code> was called, etc.
</p><p>If a step is in a conditional block, it may be reset several times in
a row without intervening runs.</p><p>A step cannot tell if it will be reset again before it runs, however,
it can tell if it will run before it is reset again. If any inputs arrive,
(are <code class="methodname">receive</code>d), then the step will be run.</p></section><section id="teardown" class="section"><div class="section-titlepage"><h3>Teardown</h3></div><pre class="programlisting language-none"><code>def teardown()</code></pre><p>Teardown is called once when the pipeline execution has finished.</p></section><section id="compound" class="section"><div class="section-titlepage"><h3>What about compound step?</h3></div><p>They’re a little bit more complicated. I’m still trying to work out
what’s going to work best.</p></section></section><section id="whatsnext" class="section"><div class="section-titlepage"><h2>What’s next?</h2></div><p>Well. Continued development, I hope. But no promises.</p></section><section id="whatif" class="section"><div class="section-titlepage"><h2>What if I want a …?</h2></div><p>Just <a href="https://github.com/ndw/jafpl/issues">file an issue</a>,
man, that’s all I got.</p></section><footer><p>Copyright © 2016 Norman Walsh. See
